# Wizard
Source-to-Source, UI, Db, and Code-Generator Tools

I have spent more years and restarted this project more times than I care to admit. However, after much contemplation and hesitation, I have finally decided to give it one last try and this time, I am going to make it open-source under the AGPL v3 license.

Most of the time spent on this project was using C#, but for this final iteration, I have decided to convert it to Python. I believe that Python is the most suitable language for this type of project.  

## What is it?

The core concept of the Wizard is to create programs, apps, websites, and web services for multiple platforms using a single specification. The goal is for the Wizard to be a no-code/low-code system, but also to support writing entire programs or libraries in a single source that can then be translated to the native language on the target platform.   

## Dual License –  AGPL v3 /  commercial

I am releasing this project under a dual-license.  You can use it under the guidelines of AGPL v3 or under a commercial license. Please contact me via [JamesRoss.Biz](https://JamesRoss.Biz)

I understand what a “user” means in the AGPL v3 – but I have not yet decided if that is the same concept I will use for the commercial license.
