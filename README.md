# Wizard
Source-to-Source, Code, UI, Db, and Code-Generator Tools

I have spent more years and restarted this project more times than I care to admit. However, after much contemplation and hesitation, I have finally decided to give it one last try and this time, I am going to make it open-source under the AGPL v3 license.

I spent the vast majority of time over the years working on this project in C#.  However on this final version I will be converting it to Python.  I believe that Python is the most appropriate language and platform for this kind of project.  I’ll delve into the reasons at a later date in a blog.

## What is it?

The core concept of the Wizard is to create programs, apps, websites, and web services for multiple platforms using a single specification. The goal is for the Wizard to be a no-code/low-code system, but also to support writing entire programs or libraries in a single source that can then be translated to the native language on the target platform.   

## Dual License –  AGPL v3 /  commercial

I am releasing this project under a dual-license.  You can use it under the guidelines of AGPL v3 or under a commercial license. Please contact me via [JamesRoss.Biz](https://JamesRoss.Biz)

I understand what a “user” means in the AGPL v3 – but I have not yet decided if that is the same concept I will use for the commercial license.
